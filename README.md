Collect all of the golden pickups in this game by rolling the ball around!

### Supported Devices
This game was designed with a Windows 32-bit system in mind, but created using the PC, Max, and Linux Standalone platform setting, so should be fine for other computer builds.

### How to Play
Use the directional controls of your keyboard or controller in order to move the ball around the level. Collect the cubes by rolling over them. **How quickly can you catch them all?**

### References
This game was created by following the [Unity Roll-a-ball Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial).

### Design Choices and Personal Contributions
There are no additional features implemented to this game.

### Future Improvements
* Randomly generate pickups across the level.
* Animate their appearance and/or disapperance.
* Add sounds to pickups, rolling around, and background music.
* Allow the ball to jump/bounce and traverse different areas of a level.
* Add a timer to see how quickly the game can be finished.
* Change textures and physics of ground to slow down/speed up/reduce control of player (mud, speed pad, ice).

### What I Learned
As an introductory tutorial to Unity, much of what I learned was related to using Unity and becoming familiar with its capabilities. I still have only seen very little of the whole picture, but Unity's potential as a game engine is now more apparent to me. Specific skills include: adding GUI text, easily adding Materials, general scripting, and reading input from the keyboard.
